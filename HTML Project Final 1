    <ul class="introfacts"> 
      <li> Elephants eat between 149 and 169 kg (330-375 lb.) of vegetation daily.</li>
<br>
      <li>Sixteen to eighteen hours, or nearly 80% of an elephantâ€™s day is spent feeding. Elephants consume grasses, small plants, bushes, fruit, twigs, tree bark, and roots. </li>
<br>
    <li>  Tree bark is a favorite food source for elephants. It contains calcium and roughage, which aids digestion. Tusks are used to carve into the trunk and tear off strips of bark. </li>

  </ul>
    <br>
